    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Compartmentalisation is important in regard to web security, where sensitive parts of the site are not accessible on the customer's version of the website. A lesson to take note of is related to the infamous video game Fallout 76, where customers was able to file complaints regarding the absent promised canvas bag of a high price Collector's Edition, on a site provided by Bethesda, but any user had full access to all tickets, being able to view the information of other people's tickets, including personal info and parts of their credit card information, as well as permission to edit these tickets. Bethesda shut down the site until they could fix the issue. It was quite the duffle kerfuffle. So make sure the general user and administrator accesses are solidly segregated, to avoid such mix-ups.</p>
